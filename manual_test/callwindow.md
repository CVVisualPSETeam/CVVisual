#Tests for the CallWindow
(The MainWindow is a CallWindow - it's not tested seperately.)

First off all: For all of the following tests, call the test_all (or the filters) test and click on the fast forward (">>") button.

1. Double click on at least 3 different items in the overview. They should open in a new tab in the main window. Double click on the same again, the call window should bring the currently open tabs to the front.
2. Use the context menu on at least 3 items in the overview to open them in a new window.
3. Open several tabs in different windows via the overview. This should work. Then move them around randomly in their windows and between different windows (use the context menu of the tabs for this test) and into new ones.
4. Open an item in a new window via the overview and close the tab of this item. The window surrounding the items tab should vanish.
5. Open several tabs in different windows via the overview. Then remove each of the tabs via the context menu of the tabs. They should vanish as well as their items in the overview.
6. Open several tabs in different windows via the overview. Close them via the close cross button and via the context menu.
7. Open several tabs in different windows via the overview. Click on an item that is already open. This should bring the appropriate tab and window to the front.
